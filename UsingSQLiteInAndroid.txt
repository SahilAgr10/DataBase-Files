To setUp a database , following are requirements :
1. Define Schema : Structure of database
2. Create Contract Class : 
    -Way to group together all constants asociated with database 
    -used when generating SQL commands which removes possibility of introducing spelling errors
    - easy to update data Schema
3. Here we implment Android class that will help us create the database in SQLite.
   -SQLiteOpenHelper Class help us create ,open and manage database connections 
     -> How  SQLiteOpenHelper Class Works ?
         1.It will create SQLite database when first accessed using either getReadable database method || using getWritableDatabase() method
	   2. Next time we open app , instaed of creating it gives you connection to existed database
	   3. Helps is updating Schema if version changes
	    Thus SQLiteOpenHelper Class is inChaarge of creating Databases.


IMPLEMENT SQLiteOpenHelper
1. Create a class that extends from SQLiteOpenHelper
2. Create constants for database name and database version
3. Create a constructor
4. Implement the onCreate() method - this method is for when the database is first created
5. Implement on Upgrade() method - is used when the schema of the database changes (ex: adding a different coloumn)
