To setUp a database , following are requirements :
1. Define Schema : Structure of database
2. Create Contract Class : 
    -Way to group together all constants asociated with database is called a Contract
    -this is used when generating SQL commands which removes possibility of introducing spelling errors
    - easy to update data Schema
3. Here we implment Android class that will help us create the database in SQLite.
   -SQLiteOpenHelper Class help us create ,open and manage database connections 
     -> How  SQLiteOpenHelper Class Works ?
         1.It will create SQLite database when first accessed using either getReadableDatabase() method || using getWritableDatabase() method
	 	getReadableDatabase()-used for read or select type actions
		getWritableDatabase()-used for create,delete,update database
	   2. Next time we open app , instaed of creating it gives you connection to existed database
	   3. Helps in updating Schema if version changes
	    Thus SQLiteOpenHelper Class is inCharge of creating Databases.


IMPLEMENT SQLiteOpenHelper
1. Create a class that extends from SQLiteOpenHelper
2. Create constants for database name and database version
3. Create a constructor
4. Implement the onCreate() method - this method is for when the database is first created
5. Implement on Upgrade() method - is used when the schema of the database changes (ex: adding a different coloumn)
6. Create and/or open a database to read from it
        SQLiteDatabase db = mDbHelper.getReadableDatabase();
	-using SQLiteDatabase object Activities can communicate with databases
7. ContentValues are used to insert new rows into tables. Each Content Values object represents a single table row as a map of column names to values.
   Queries in Android are returned as Cursor objects. Rather than extracting and returning a copy of the result values, Cursors are pointers to the result set within the    underlying data. Cursors provide a managed way of controlling your position (row) in the result set of a database query.
